                <p class="lead">A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept 
                    primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than 
                    as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular
                     pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, 
                     intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be 
                     taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and 
                     accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.</p>
